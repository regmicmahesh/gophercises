In this repository, I will try to maintain my progress of doing [Gophercises](https://github.com/gophercises)

## Introduction to Gophercises
Gophercises is a **FREE** course that will help you become more familiar with Go while developing your skills as a programmer. In the course we will build roughly 20 different mini-applications, packages, and tools that are each designed to teach you something different.


In the course we will learn about and practice using:

- Channels
- Mutexes
- Goroutines
- Functional Options
- Chaining Interfaces
- Various parts of the standard library (io, time, and many other packages)
- Reading input from the command line
- And much much more!


By completing the exercises in Gophercises you will slowly become more confident using the Go programming language. You will start to learn how to read the standard docs and make sense of them. You will even start to learn how to evaluate the difficulty of a project before doing much coding. In short, you will start to become a great Go developer.
